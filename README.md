Radix
====

A rust crate to convert numbers between radices.

NOTE
----
You'll need Rust `>= 1.26` to use this crate.
This crate uses the `conservative_impl_trait` nightly feature,
which is likely to be stabilized in `rustc 1.26`.
For now `1.26` is still a nightly version.  But when it becomes stable,
so will `radix` be buildable on stable Rust.
